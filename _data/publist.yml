  image: BEE2023.jpg
  description: If you are interested on seeing how rubber content in rubber-sand mixtures (RSm) affects liquefaction susceptibility, stiffness and geomechanical behaviour, then this is a must read. We have used Juan Bernal-Sanchez's PhD data together with existing literature to investigate teh relationship between the PSD characteristics of RSm and their stiffness and susceptibility to liquefaction.

  image: fraction.jpg
  description: In this study, grading entropy coordinates are compared to three commonly used breakage indices (Br, Br* and IG). It is shown that grading entropy coordinates are advantageous over the traditional indices in quantifying subtle changes in the PSD evolution and directly provide further insight with regards to the individual fraction sizes.

  description: A Geotechnical Seismic Isolation (GSI) system is proposed in this study based on the use of Rubber-Soil mixtures (RSm) to facilitate the benefits of dynamic soil-foundation structure interaction. The results have shown that the rubber addition results in a reduction of the amplification at frequencies higher than the system natural frequency.

  description: A coupled bio-thermal (BT) model is proposed and validated for the prediction of long-term biochemical and thermal behavior of municipal solid waste (MSW) in landfills. The results show that incorporating the effect of temperature of waste in the modeling of biodegradation of waste in landfills plays a significant role in realistically predicting the long-term biochemical and thermal regime in MSW landfills. The proposed BT model captures the key trends in the landfill gas (LFG) production and waste temperatures typically observed in actual full-scale landfills.

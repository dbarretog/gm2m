We are an active research group at the 
[School of Computing, Engineering and the Built Environment](https://www.napier.ac.uk/about-us/our-schools/school-of-computing-engineering-and-the-built-environment). 
We study the mechanical behaviour of soils and other granular materials, using a micro-to-macro approach involving advanced laboratory testing, 
numerical simulation and phenomenological approaches to modelling. We have extensive experience using the Discrete Element Method (DEM) for 
micro-scale simulation and advanced continuum models to investigate macro-scale behaviour. Some of our work has involved complex materials such as 
rubber-sand-mixtures, dissolving soils, and biodegradabale materials, amongst others.

We also use techniques such as x-Ray micro-computed tomography, soil element and model testing of soils and soil-structure interaction, and advanced 
statistical concepts (i.e. grading entropy) to understand how micro-scale (particulate) properties affect macro-scale soil behaviour such as that observed 
for shallow and deep foundations, retaining walls, and landfill facilities, amongst others.

We are located at Edinburgh Napier University, assessed in REF2021 as the top Scottish modern university for both research power and research impact with 
68 per cent of our research now assessed as “internationally excellent” or “world leading”. We also exchange ideas and work with our colleagues 
from the [Geotechnical Seismic Isolation Global Network](https://www.gsi-global.org/home), and Edinburgh Napier's Centre for Conservation and Restoration Science.

 **We are always looking for passionate new PhD students, Postdocs, and Master students to join the team** 


We are grateful for funding received for our research projects including, [BE-ST](https://www.be-st.build/), [Royal Academy of Engineering](https://raeng.org.uk/), [Royal Society of Edinburgh](https://rse.org.uk/)), and [Hungarian Academy of Sciences](https://mta.hu/english), amongst others.
